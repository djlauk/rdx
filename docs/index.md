# rdx documentation

Welcome to the documentation of the rdx project. Here's how it is organized:

- [Tutorials](#tutorials) guide you through your first steps of learning your way around rdx.
- [How to guides](#how-to-guides) take you through the typical steps to accomplish common tasks.
- [Background information](#background-information) will help you understand the motivation for and reasoning behind rdx.
- And last, not least, the [reference section](#reference) will provide you with details on the API, short and sweet, and to the point.

**Please note**: The documentation is currently being worked on a lot. So, unfortunately, a lot of it is still placeholders to give you an idea, what's going to come up.

## Tutorials

The tutorials are especially beginner friendly. Experienced JavaScript developers may want to just skim over them or even skip them alltogether. No offense taken ;-)

- Your first model: Creating a simple counter with rdx
- Going asynchronous: Creating a countdown timer with rdx
- Connecting to remote APIs: Creating a todo list application with rdx

## How to guides

- How to utilize the `connect(...)` mixin with web components
